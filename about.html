      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <img src="https://static.thenounproject.com/png/992984-200.png" alt="About Me Icon" style="width:80px; height:auto; margin-bottom:15px;">
      <p>I’m originally from Mauritius and East Africa, and I grew up between Dubai and London. Being raised in both the Middle East and the UK exposed me to a wide range of cultures, perspectives, and ways of life, which has shaped my diverse global background. This international upbringing has influenced how I approach problem-solving, communication, and collaboration, with a culturally aware and inclusive mindset.</p>

      <p>I earned my undergraduate degree from King’s College London, where I developed a strong foundation in communication and global politics. Currently, I am pursuing a Master of Science in Management at Georgetown University’s McDonough School of Business, where I am expanding my expertise in leadership, data-driven decision-making, and cross-functional collaboration to prepare for a dynamic career in business and innovation.</p>

      <p>My background includes diverse experience in public relations and marketing, with a focus on the luxury fashion and retail sectors. I’ve had the opportunity to work with high-end brands, supporting product launches, media outreach, influencer partnerships, and event planning tailored to premium audiences. Additionally, I’ve gained insight into the fast-evolving world of cryptocurrency, where I supported strategic communications and brand positioning efforts in an emerging tech environment. This blend of traditional luxury and cutting-edge innovation has shaped my adaptable and globally minded approach to marketing.</p>

      <img src="https://static.thenounproject.com/png/5562262-200.png" alt="Interests Icon" style="width:80px; height:auto; margin-bottom:15px;">
      <p>I’m passionate about the world of luxury retail, where storytelling, brand identity, and customer experience come together to create lasting impact. I’m equally enthusiastic about social media and its power to build communities, drive engagement, and shape brand narratives in real time. Event planning and management is another area I enjoy, especially the creative process of crafting memorable experiences from concept to execution. And of course, I’m an avid sports watcher — whether it’s football, American football, or Formula 1, I find energy and inspiration in the strategy, teamwork, and passion that define the world of sports.</p>
